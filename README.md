QRTEngine
=========

Qualtrics Reaction Time Engine (QRTEngine) is an extension to Qualtrics which allows researchers, but generally any who are interested, to easily build behavioural experiments online.
It was created as an extension to the Qualtrics Survey Platform in browser-native languages - JavaScript, CSS and HTML(5) - so no external plugins (such as Flash, Java) are required on the participant's side in order to run an experiment created with this Engine.

This project contains both the code for the library (check out the 'Lib' folder) and the API documentation created using YUIDOC (check the 'out' folder). For explanation on how to use the QRTEngine, please refer to our website (http://qrtengine.com)
