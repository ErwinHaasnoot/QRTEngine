QRTEngine
=========

Qualtrics Reaction Time Engine (QRTEngine) is an extension to Qualtrics which allows researchers, but generally any who are interested, to easily build behavioural online experiments.
It was created in browser-native languages - JavaScript, CSS and HTML(5), so no external plugins (such as Flash, Java) are required on the participant's side in order to run an experiment created with this Engine.
